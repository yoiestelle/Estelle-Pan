# Time Series Analysis of Social Acceptance Toward Homosexuality

This project aims to analyze the trends in attitudes towards sexual relations between adults of the same sex over time, while exploring how age, gender, and educational levels are correlated with these attitudes.

The variables I have selected for this analysis are: "homosex," "year," "age," "sex," and "educ."

I chose the variable "homosex" to study the changing attitudes towards sexual relations between adults of the same sex over different periods. Here are the description and corresponding scales: 1: always wrong, 2: almost always wrong, 3: wrong only sometimes, 4: not wrong at all, 5: other

Additionally, I included the variables 'age' and 'sex' to examine differences in attitudes towards same-sex relations among different gender and age groups. Furthermore, I incorporated the variable "educ" to explore how differences in educational levels impact acceptance of homosexuality.
